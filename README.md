In this work, we present video effects that are created using a semantic segmentation technique that is based on convolutional neural networks. 
The effects include person outline, background change, and RGB glitch effect.m


## How to run.



To be able to run our program you need to install the following libraries:

```
$ pip install tensorflow
$ pip install pyqt5
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install opencv-python
$ pip install PIL
$ pip install segmentation-models
```
Make sure to have a source video with the name "test.mp4" in the same directory as main.py. 
Run the main.py.
Have fun!
